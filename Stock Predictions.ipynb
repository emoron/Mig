    "Algorithms that can correctly predict stock prices can help generate millions of dollars. In this one-player game, you try to predict the rise and fall of the stock price of various stocks and buy or sell the stocks accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with $100. Each turn you will be given the stock prices of current day and previous 4 days. You must then choose to BUY or SELL the stocks. Your program will be run with input for 1 day at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock prices are generated by us and may contain patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The input of each turn will consist of multiple lines. All money values are doubles to two decimal places, all other numbers are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains three space separated numbers m k d.\n",
    "\n",
    "m - the amount of money you could spend that day.\n",
    "k - the number of different stocks available for buying or selling.\n",
    "d - the number of remaining days for trading stocks.\n",
    "k lines follow, each in the following format: name owned prices\n",
    "\n",
    "name - the name of the stock (a string).\n",
    "owned - the number of shares you own of that stock.\n",
    "prices - 5 space separated numbers representing the stock's price for the last 5 days. These are ordered from oldest to newest, so the last number is the current stock price.\n",

    "Output Format\n",

    "Output N for the number of transactions you wish to make. Output 0 if you are not making any transactions that day.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have 90 dollars and 10 iStreet stocks. You decide to sell the iStreet stocks, then purchase 5 HR stocks. After the transactions you will have 90 - 17.50 x 5 + 7.60 x 10 = 78.5 dollars and 5 HR stock for the next days trading.\n",

    "\n",
    "Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You trade until you run out of days. Any stocks left on the last day will automatically be sold at the last day's market price. Your objective is to make as much money as possible starting from $100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the function printTransactions that takes a float m money left, an integer k number of stocks, an integer d days left, a string array name of stock names, an integer array owned of stocks owned, and an 2d integer array prices of stock prices containing k arrays of length 5 and print your output.\n",
